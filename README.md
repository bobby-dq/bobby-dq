Hi, my name is Bobby Quilacio and a Computing Science student at the Universty of Alberta. I started my development journey by teaching myself Python on May 2020.

I then moved on to working with C# / ASP.NET and Typescript / React. I also started taking on freelance projects to gain a better grasp of web development. I then founded a web studio to combine two of the things I am passionate about - development and photography. I then attended the University of Alberta on Fall 2021 to study Computing Science.
